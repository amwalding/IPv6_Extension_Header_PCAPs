# IPv6_Extension_Header_PCAPs
Here are a collection of IPv6 Extension Header packet captures for those interested in what they look like in Wireshark.

I searched and searched and could not find a good source of IPv6 extension header samples.  Here they are.
Granted there is an entire argument that Extension Headers should be banned, and in fact in many countries service providers, they are.  I would encourage those interested to go look at Geoff Huston's IPv6 Lab page here where they test this daily: https://stats.labs.apnic.net/v6frag

That said, if you are a researcher like me I hope this little repository helps.  You may also want to grab my IPv6 Wireshark Profiles from that repository.

If you want to contribute - please let me know.
